#GrassStep

Turn dirt into grass just by walking on it!

Inspired by https://bukkit.org/threads/grass-step-plugin.483177/

When a player moves on a dirt block, it will change to a grass block and will spawn particles periodically.

Toggleable and a counter feature is present as well; counts the amount of blocks changed from dirt to grass.
